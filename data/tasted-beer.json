We brewed up a wort with a light caramel note and some toasty biscuit flavour, and hopped it with Amarillo and Centennial for a citrusy bitterness. Everything else is down to the yeast. Pilsner yeast ferments with no fruity esters or spicy phenols, although it can add a hint of butterscotch.","imageURL":"https://images.punkapi.com/v2/4.png","color":"Garde","hasLiked":true},{"alcoolByVolume":4.5,"bitterness":60,"color":"Extra special bitter","id":1,"name":"Buzz","description":"A light, crisp and bitter IPA brewed with English and American hops.
